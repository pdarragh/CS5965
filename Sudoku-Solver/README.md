## Purpose

This project's purpose is to build a sudoku solver. I want the following features to be implemented:

- Read a board from stdio (maybe)
- Generate a solution to the board
- Generate a random board (and solution)
- Output solution to stdio
- Output solution to file
- Verify a given board
