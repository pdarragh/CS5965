  - Duchy
  - Provinces
* 10 sets of Kingdom cards
* Curse cards

Different Kingdom cards can be chosen at the beginning of the game.

## Playing

### Turn Order

* Action
  - can play one Action card initially
  - may play more if your Action entitles you to more actions
* Buy
  - you may purchase one card: Kingdom, Treasure, Victory, or Curse using Treasure in hand plus coin accumulated during Action phase
  - may purchase additional cards if you gained a Buy during the Action phase
* Clean Up
  - discard played cards
  - discard cards in hand
  - draw 5 new cards

### Game-Ending Conditions
  - Province pile is exhausted
  - Any 3 supply piles are exhausted

### Winning

When the game ends, players add up value of all Victory cards. The player with the highest total wins.

If there is a tie, the leaders add up the value of their Treasure cards to determine the winner.

If there is still a tie, the winners share the victory.

### Other Conditions

* if you are to draw a card, but your Draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your new draw pile

## Kingdom Action Cards

* Action
  - simply do what they say
* Action/Victory
  - do what they say
  - add to Victory total during the end-game phase
* Action/Attack

  - secondary ability to be used in response to Attack card
